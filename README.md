## Managed Ethernet Switch Overview

A managed Ethernet switch allows administrators to configure, monitor, and segment network traffic. Versitron managed switches are commonly used where VLANs, traffic prioritization, and fiber uplinks are required to support structured LAN and campus network designs.

These switches can be deployed at the access or aggregation layer and are designed to integrate seamlessly into fiber-based Ethernet networks.

## Deployment Roles

### Managed access layer switch
Used to connect edge devices such as workstations, IP devices, or cameras while providing fiber uplinks to upstream switches.

### Managed aggregation network switch
Aggregates traffic from multiple access switches and forwards it over fiber backbone links with traffic control and segmentation.

### DIN-rail managed Ethernet switch
Selected models support DIN-rail mounting for use in control cabinets and structured network enclosures.

### Managed switch for business networks
Supports business LANs that require visibility, segmentation, and stable fiber connectivity without excessive complexity.
